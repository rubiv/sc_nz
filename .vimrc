" My personally preferred version of vim is the one with the "big" feature
" set, in addition to the following configure options:
"
"     ./configure --with-features=BIG
"                 --enable-pythoninterp --enable-rubyinterp
"                 --enable-enablemultibyte --enable-gui=no --with-x --enable-cscope

" To start vim without using this .vimrc file, use:
"     vim -u NORC
"
" To start vim without loading any .vimrc or plugins, use:
"     vim -u NONE
"

" Use vim settings, rather then vi settings (much better!)
" This must be first, because it changes other options as a side effect.
